# Testing

This repo contains code for you to test your solution two different ways. One is
to use RSpec and the other is to run ad-hoc tests with ruby code written for you.

To run the specs simply run `rspec spec/mass_object_spec.rb`

To run the ad-hoc tests simply run `ruby test/ruby_mass_object_test.rb`

These specs are to act as a basic guide to show you how one would use the
framework you're building.
