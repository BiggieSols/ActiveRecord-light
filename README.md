<h1>ActiveRecord Lite</h1>
This is a minimally-featured version of ActiveRecord that allows for basic associations (has-many, belongs-to), and a simple belongs-to-through association. Uses metaprogramming to build many of the simpler ActiveRecord functions.

<h3>Features</h3>
* auto-create setters and getters
* "find_by_x_and_y_and_z" tool that accepts dynamic arguments
* database CRUD actions
* designed to be inherited by Rails models
